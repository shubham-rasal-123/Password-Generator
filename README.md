This project is a Password Generator built with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads) that creates secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria. The program allows users to specify the desired password length and whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generator then produces a strong, unpredictable password suitable for secure account protection. This project is a great way to practice Python skills like string manipulation, randomization, and working with user input.
